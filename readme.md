**Empowering the Next Generation of Developers: Balancing Discipline and Adaptability**

The Akto Incubator has established itself as a driving force for innovation and community growth, fostering a supportive environment that empowers young developers to reach their full potential. By combining cutting-edge technology, community engagement, and real-world applications, participants develop a wide range of projects, from AI-powered software to social platforms, assistive technologies, and mobile games.

However, the journey to excellence is not without its challenges. The incubator's founder has come to realize that a more nuanced approach is needed, one that balances discipline and adaptability. Initially, a technocratic approach was emphasized, but the founder has learned that this approach may not be suitable for all students. He has faced criticism for being too strict and has come to appreciate the value of trust and giving participants the autonomy to take ownership of their projects.

In refining his approach, the founder emphasizes the importance of repetition and practice in developing skills. He notes that success is not achieved through shortcuts or quick fixes, but rather through dedication and perseverance. He encourages participants to push through periods of burnout and frustration, as these are inevitable in any field.

The founder also adopts a unique approach to mentorship, where he spends 80% of his time working on his own projects and 20% coaching the next generation. This approach allows him to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices, making him a more effective mentor. He believes that this format enables him to "hone his own blade" and become a better role model for the participants.

The founder's approach is guided by the principle that praise and recognition should be earned, rather than simply given, as this can create a sense of complacency and limit one's potential. By embracing this approach, the incubator is empowering the next generation of developers to reach new heights and achieve their full potential.

Ultimately, the Akto Incubator's journey serves as a testament to the importance of finding a balance between discipline and adaptability in driving innovation and growth. By striking a balance between structure and flexibility, the incubator continues to be a driving force for excellence in the world of technology and beyond.
